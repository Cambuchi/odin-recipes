            <ul>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 medium-sized tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 tbsp cooking oil, preferably sesame (15mL)</li>
                <li>a pinch of salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp sugar (1g)</li>
                <li>1 scallion, diced into 1.5 inch (4mm) slices</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Whisk eggs with a pinch of salt until the yolk and eggs are
                    thoroughly mixed. Ideally, there should be a thin layer of small
                    bubbles at the very top; in practice, thorough mixing is
                    sufficient.</li>
                <li>Slice tomatoes into approximately 6 wedges each. Optional:
                    remove the top, hardened/brown part of the tomato near the
                    stem for taste.</li>
                <li>Heat a pan or wok to medium-high. Add 1 tablespoon of oil
                    when hot, then pour the egg mixture in. Let sit, undisturbed,
                    until the mixture is partially firmed and 70-80% cooked. Turn
                    the fire off and break egg into smaller pieces with spatula.
                    Transfer eggs out of wok; leave some oil.</li>
                <li>Turn the stove back on to medium-high, add tomato wedges,
                    and stir fry until the tomatoes are slightly darkened and juicy.</li>
                <li>Return the egg pieces to wok and add salt, sugar, and scallion
                    pieces. Make sure some tomato juices are mixed with the egg
                    for visual appeal and taste. Enjoy immediately, either
                    accompanied with rice or on its own!</li>
