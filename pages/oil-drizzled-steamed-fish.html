        <section id="ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>10.5 oz fillet of fresh white saltwater fish, skin on (300g)</li>
                <li>1/4 thumb of ginger, sliced</li>
                <li>1 thumb of ginger, cut into needles</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce (15mL)</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp shaoxing wine (2.5mL)</li>
                <li>1 tsp sesame oil (5mL), or to taste.</li>
                <li>parsley, for garnish</li>
                <li>scallions, shredded, for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="directions">
            <ol>
                <li>Pat fillet dry and make some incisions at 45 degrees into the
                    fish and stick the sliced ginger in. Marinate for about 15
                    minutes. Meanwhile, prepare your steamer.</li>
                <li>Put the fish on a dish, skin up. Top with ginger needles. Steam
                    on high heat for about 8-10 mins.</li>
                <li>Mix the soy sauce and shaoxing wine together and pour over
                    the fish.</li>
                <li>Put the fish back into the steamer and steam for about
                    another 5 minutes, or until the fish is done. You might want to
                    put a toothpick through the thickest part of the fish - if there is
                    equal resistance all throughout the fillet and it comes out
                    cleanly, itâ€™s done!</li>
                <li>Drizzle the sesame oil over evenly. Remove the ginger slices
                    (for aesthetic purposes) and top with the parsley and
                    scallions (if any). Cover the steamer again for another 10
                    seconds to cook the greens slightly to remove some of the
                    bitterness.</li>
                <li>Eat with rice!</li>
